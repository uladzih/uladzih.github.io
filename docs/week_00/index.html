OpenGL is a library for creating three-dimensional graphics. The last time I used it was a couple of years ago. That was a long time ago, and I didn't do anything particularly interesting. Therefore, it can be considered that I am starting my journey from scratch.
  </p>

  <p>
I remember that there are two modes of operation in OpenGL: the old one, called immediate mode, and the new core-profile mode. In modern development, it's advised not to use immediate mode because it is slow, outdated, and removed from the latest versions of OpenGL; however, it is simpler and easier to start drawing with. On the other hand, core-profile mode works faster, is closer to the hardware, and therefore more complex.
  </p>

  <p>
Without any doubt, I decided to use the core-profile mode. Many posts and blogs on the Internet refer to the site learnopengl.com as the best resource for learning modern OpenGL, so I started with it.
  </p>

  <p>
The first lessons explain the basic foundation and principles of how OpenGL works from a high-level perspective, and also describe how to install the necessary libraries to start programming. I didn't encounter any particular problems with this since I already have extensive experience programming in C and understand the basic principles of that language. As a result, I managed to render a simple window.
  </p>
  
  <p>
I quickly moved on to the "Hello Triangle" lesson, which describes how to draw a triangle. At this point, I had to pay close attention. The lesson explained everything: the structure of the rendering pipeline, the coordinate system, vertex buffers, shaders, and so on. And all of this just to draw one simple triangle!
  </p>
  
  <p>
Initially, the triangle simply refused to appear on the screen. But I quickly realized that the reason was that I had changed the function's prototype to return a buffer index instead of setting it via a pointer in the parameter. In other words, I originally wrote the function as:
  </p>
  
  <div class="snippet">void triangle_init(unsigned int *VAO) {...}</div>

  <p>
and called it like this:
  </p>

  <div class="snippet">triangle_init(&VAO);</div>
  <p>
Later, I changed the prototype to:
  </p>
<div class="snippet">unsigned int triangle_init() {...}</div>
  <p>
but didn't change the call:
  </p>
<div class="snippet">triangle_init(&VAO);</div>
  <p>
The C compiler doesn't forbid passing parameters to functions with an empty parameter list and doesn't produce an error. Therefore, the correct declaration should have been:
  </p>
<div class="snippet">unsigned int triangle_init(void) {...}</div>
  <p>
After all the corrections, the triangle finally appeared. The next lesson shows how to draw a rectangle from two triangles using an element buffer object. There were no issues with that part:

I must admit, it wasn't easy, but I'm glad that everything worked out!
